            This MMORPG is a little bit different... you’ve been warned.
            Adventure Quest 3D is a growing online world where you can be anyone
            or anything you want. Battle monsters as a Mage. Change Classes
            anytime. Craft items, swords, and fidget spinners. Fish with
            friends. Or crush ‘em all in 5v5 PvP. Adopt a weird looking cat
            called a Moglin. And explore the vast open world as… a bush. AQ3D is
            pretty much the metaverse before the metaverse was a thing.
            <br />Epic quests of adventure… and some really strange stuff… await
            thee in Adventure Quest 3D! SORCERER GENERAL'S WARNING This game is
            ONLY for fans of fantasy MMO open world games, passionately involved
            game developers, and heroes who wandered here by mistake but
            downloaded AdventureQuest and loved it anyway. May contain Artix’s
            unpredictable tongue-in-cheek humor, parody, puns, memes, dad jokes,
            and oddly-fused monsters (Werepyres?). AQ3D is so casually hard core
            that there is a 99% chance you will die before the game even begins.
            But maybe you'll get lucky and DEATH (aka The Grim Reaper) will make
            you a deal you can't refuse. Seems legit. Probably safe.
          </p>
